# hello-world
Hello,
  My name is Jonathan Urbieta and I used to be an engineer major but I switched to computer science because I love the creativity that comes from this field. I hope to learn a lot and make many interesting applications with what I learn. I already know a bit of c++ and javascript but I want to learn more c# in order to become a great game developer. :)
